# SE-Assignment-2

Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering Instructions: Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.
Questions: 
1.	Define Software Engineering: 
•	What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
 	It is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.
 	It differs from traditional programming as traditional programming is mainly concerned with coding. 

2.	Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
•	Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. 
 	Project Planning - It explains what is needed for a particular project and also looks at the estimated costs of the projects. This phase also looks at the new software requirements.
 	Define requirements - This stage is about gathering relevant information from the client regarding the requirements for the product. 
 	Design – At this stage the developer checks if the requirements will be relevant to the software that needs to be designed. The developer checks whether the prepared software meets all the requirements of the end-user.
 	Development - This stage is about translating the design to a computer language.
 	Testing – This stage tests the functionality of the entire system and this is done to ensure that the entire application works according to the customer requirements.
 	Deployment - This is where the product is released to customers to use, in cases where it is noted that there is need for training then training is provided to avoid any uncertainties about the system.
 	Maintenance - This is where the developed project is taken care of, in case there are glitches or updates that are needed.


3.	Agile vs. Waterfall Models: 
•	Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. 
 	Agile is ideal for dynamic environments and continuous improvement initiatives, while Waterfall is preferable for projects with well-defined requirements and strict deadlines.

•	What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? 
 	Agile model needs a continuous risk management whereas Waterfall model needs risk management at the beginning.
 	Agile model has minimal documentation whereas Waterfall model has extensive documentation.
 	With Agile model it is not easy to estimate time and cost whereas with Waterfall model it is easy to estimate time and cost.
A
4.	Requirements Engineering: 
•	What is requirements engineering? 
 	It is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process, this also looks at the expectations of stakeholders for a software system.
•	Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. 
 	This process tells everyone involved with the project what needs to be done.
 	It is important as it proper management improves project clarity, reduces errors, and aligns expectations.

5.	Software Design Principles:
•	Explain the concept of modularity in software design. 
 	It refers to a process of dividing a system into separate modules or components.
•	How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? 
 	It helps each module to handle a specific functionality and operates independently.

6.	Testing in Software Engineering:
•	Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). 
 	Unit Testing: Tests individual components or units of the application for correctness. Integration Testing: Tests the interaction between different modules or systems. Performance Testing: Measures the application's response time, scalability, and resource usage under various conditions. 
Acceptance Testing: evaluates whether a system meets its business and user requirements.
•	Why is testing crucial in software development? 
 	It improves consistency and performance, it also help find errors and defects. It also helps the team in understanding actual and expected outcomes so that they can improve the quality of their products.

7.	Version Control Systems:
•	What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? 
 	They are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
 	They are important because they keep track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.
•	Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. 
 	Git, Bitkeeper, Helix Core and Darcs

8.	Software Project Management:
•	Discuss the role of a software project manager. 
 	A project manager is the person who has the overall responsibility for the successful initiation, planning, design, execution, monitoring, controlling and closure of a project. Project manager is responsible to complete the project within time, cost and quality towards making the project a success.
•	What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? 
 	Misalignment between goals and business objectives.
 	Poor communication.
 	Lack of accountability.
 	Inadequate resource allocation.
 	Poor planning and unrealistic deadlines.

9.	Software Maintenance:
•	Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. 
 	It is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs and it is done after the product has launched.
 	The different types of software maintenance are as follows:
o	Corrective Software Maintenance.
o	Adaptive Software Maintenance.
o	Perfective Software Maintenance.
o	Preventive Software Maintenance.
•	Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? 
 	It is crucial to maintain software functionality, make upgrades to the coding, and ensure any repairs needed to the software are completed.

10.	Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
•	What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? 
 	Lack of moral compass. 
 	Deviation in the professional guidelines to make responsible decisions and ensuring that the products and services they develop align with societal values and expectations.
•	How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? 
 	Adhere to moral compass.
 	Abide with professional guidelines to make responsible decisions and ensuring that the products and services they develop align with societal values and expectations.
